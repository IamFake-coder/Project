    <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">ESFP: The Performer (Extraverted, Sensing, Feeling, Perceiving)</h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="para-1">
      <p>
        ESFP (extraverted, sensing, feeling, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality types identified by the
        Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.1 People with ESFP personality types are often described as spontaneous,
        resourceful, and outgoing. They love being the center of attention and are often described as entertainers or
        “class clowns.” ESFP is the opposite of the INTJ personality type.

        According to psychologist David Keirsey, the developer of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately 4% to
        10% of all people have an ESFP personality type.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>Key ESFP Characteristics</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>ESFPs tend to be very practical and resourceful. They prefer to learn through hands-on experience and tend
          to
          dislike book learning and theoretical discussions. Because of this, students with ESFP personality types
          sometimes
          struggle in traditional classroom settings. However, they excel in situations where they are allowed to
          interact
          with others or learn through direct experience.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>ESFPs live very much in the here-and-now and sometimes fail to think about how current actions will lead to
          long-term consequences. They will often rush into a new situation and figure things out as they happen. They
          also
          tend to dislike routine, enjoy new experiences, and are always looking for a new adventure.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>In addition to having a strong awareness of their surroundings, they are also very understanding and
          perceptive
          when it comes to other people. They are able to sense what others are feeling and know how to respond. People
          tend
          to find them warm, sympathetic, and easygoing.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>While ESFPs are fun-loving and do not shun the spotlight, they are more interested in simply living in the
          present
          and doing what feels right at that moment.</li>
      </p>


    </div>
    <div class="card-1">
      <h4> Strengths </h4>
      <hr>
      <p>
        <li>Optimistic and gregarious</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Enjoys people and socializing</li>
      </p>

        <li>Practical</li>

      <h4> Weaknesses </h4>

      <p>
        <li>Dislikes abstract theories</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Becomes bored easily</li>

      </p>
    </div>

    <h4> Cognitive Functions</h4>
    <p>The MBTI suggests that individual personalities are marked by many different cognitive functions (sensing,
      thinking,
      feeling, and intuition). Some of these are more dominant than others and the hierarchical order of these functions
      influences how people perceive and relate to the world.</p>

    <p>These functions are focused outwardly (extraverted) and in other cases, they are focused inwardly (introverted).
      Extraverted functions are focused on interacting and acting within the world around you, while introverted
      functions
      are centered on internal reflection and analysis.</p>

    <h4>Dominant: Extraverted Sensing</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>ESFPs prefer to focus on the here-and-now rather than thinking about the distant future. They also prefer
          learning
          about concrete facts rather than theoretical ideas.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>ESFPs don’t spend a lot of time planning and organizing. Instead, they like to keep their options open.
          When solving problems, they trust their instincts and put trust in their own abilities to come up with a
          solution.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>While they are reasonable and pragmatic, they dislike structure, order, and planning. Instead, they act
          spontaneously and do not spend a great deal of time coming up with a plan or schedule.</li>
      </p>
      </p>
    </div>

    <h4>Auxiliary: Introverted Feeling</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>ESFPs place a greater emphasis on personal feelings rather than logic and facts when making decisions.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>People with this personality type have an internal system of values on which they base their decisions. They
          are
          very much aware of their own emotions and are empathetic towards others. They excel at putting themselves in
          another person's shoes, so to speak.</li>
      </p>

    </div>

    <h4>Tertiary: Extraverted Thinking</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>This function is focused on enforcing order on the outside world. It is centered on productivity, logic, and
          results.</li>
      </p>
      <p>
        <li>Because this tends to be a weaker aspect of personality, ESFPs may not always feel secure sharing their
          judgments,
          especially if they feel it will disrupt the harmony of the group.</li>
      </p>

    </div>

    <h4>Inferior: Introverted Intuition</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <P>
        <li>While this is the least prominent aspect of personality, this function can help the ESFP spot patterns and
          make
          connections in things they have observed.</li>
      </P>

      <P>
        <li>ESFPs are usually not particularly adept at using logic to sort through abstract concepts, but this sense
          can
          sometimes lead to flashes of insight and epiphanies about themselves or the world.</li>

    <h4>Tips for Interacting With ESFPs</h4>

    <h5> Friendships</h5>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>ESFPs grow weary with the same old routines and are always ready for a new adventure. To keep up with this
        personality type, you need to always be ready for new experiences - from exploring new places to meeting new
        people. Keeping things interesting is important, but ESFPs love to have a reliable co-conspirator who is as
        ready for fun as they are.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h5>Parenting</h5>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        ESFP children are enthusiastic and energetic, which can be both fun and exhausting for parents. You can help by
        providing plenty of outlets for this boundless energy. Sports, hobbies, and outdoor adventures are all good
        sources of fun for ESFP kids. While these kids are people-loving extraverts, they may need time alone to process
        their feelings when they are upset. Be sure to give them some time before drawing them out to discuss their
        emotions.
      </p></div>

      <h5>Relationships</h5>
      <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        ESFPs tend to be honest and forthright in relationships. They don't play games and are warm and enthusiastic in
        romantic relationships. One thing to remember is that ESFPs dislike conflict and tend to take any critical
        comments quite personally. While it is important to be straightforward in your relationship with an ESFP, try to
        avoid being overly harsh or confrontational.
