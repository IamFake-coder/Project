        <div class="para-1">
        The acronym ENTJ represents one of the 16 personality types that are identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. This popular personality assessment was developed by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs. The assessment tool is based on Carl Jung's theory of personality types. Other people often describe people with this type of personality as assertive, confident, and outspoken.

        According to psychologist David Keirsey, the ENTJ type is quite rare, accounting for a mere 2% of the population.

      <h4>Key ENTJ Characteristics</h4>
      <div class="para-2">
        <p>
      <li>People with this personality type enjoy spending time with other people. They have strong verbal skills and interacting with others helps them feel energized.</li>
      <li>ENTJ types prefer to think about the future rather than focus on the here-and-now. They usually find abstract and theoretical information more interesting than concrete details.</li>
      <li>When making decisions, ENTJs place a greater emphasis on objective and logical information. Personal feelings and the emotions of others tend not to factor much into their choices.</li>
      <li>ENTJs are planners. Making decisions and having a schedule or course of action planned out gives them a sense of predictability and control.</li>
      <li>They are highly rational, good at spotting problems, and excel at taking charge. These tendencies make them natural leaders who are focused on efficiently solving problems.</li>
      <li>ENTJs are not necessarily good with emotions, but that does not mean they are intentionally cruel. They are prone to hiding their own emotions and sentimentality, viewing it as a weakness that should not be made known to others.</li>
    </p>
    </div>

    <div class="card-1">

      <h4>Cognitive Functions</h4>
      <p>
      Based upon the Jungian personality theory, the MBTI suggests that personality is composed of several different cognitive functions.2 These functions can be focused primarily outward (extraverted) or inward (introverted).
      Each function relates to how people perceive the world and make decisions. The dominant function is the most prominent aspect of personality, while the auxiliary function plays a supporting role. The tertiary function has a weaker influence but can become more apparent when a person is under stress. The inferior function is primarily unconscious and is often a point of weakness. Developing this aspect can help people form a more balanced personality.
    </p>

      <h4>Dominant: Extraverted Thinking</h4>
      <div class="para-2">
      <p>
      <li>This is an ENTJ preferred function and is expressed through the way they make decisions and judgments.</li>
      <li>ENTJs tend to speak first without listening, making snap judgments before really taking in all the information about a situation.</li>
      <li>While they tend to make snap judgments, they are also very rational and objective. They are focused on imposing order and standards on the world around them. Setting measurable goals is important.</li>
    </p>
    </div>


      <h4>Auxiliary: Introverted Intuition</h4>
      <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>People with this personality type are future-focused and always consider the possibilities when approaching a decision.</li>
        <li>ENTJs are forward-thinking and are not afraid of change. They trust their instincts, although they tend to regret jumping to conclusions so quickly.</li>
    </p>
    </div>

      <h4>Tertiary: Extraverted Sensing</h4>
      <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>This cognitive function gives ENTJs an appetite for adventure. They enjoy novel experiences and may sometimes engage in thrill-seeking behaviors.</li>
        <li>Because of their outward sensory focus, they also have an appreciation for beautiful things in life. They often enjoy surrounding themselves with things that they find attractive or interesting.</li>
    </p>
    </div>

      <h4>Inferior: Introverted Feeling</h4>
      <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>Introverted feeling is centered on internal feelings and values. Emotions can be difficult area for ENTJs, and they often lack an understanding of how this part of their personality contributes to their decision-making process.</li>
        <li>When this aspect of personality is weak, ENTJs may find themselves feeling uncomfortable or awkward in settings where some type of emotional response is called for.</li>
    </p>

      <h4>Tips for Interacting With ENTJs</h4>

      <h5>Friendships</h5>
      <div class="para-2">
      <p>
      ENTJ are social people and love engaging conversations. While they can seem argumentative and confrontational at times, just remember that this is part of their communication style. Try not to take it personally. They tend to have the easiest friendships with people who share their interests and views and may struggle to understand people who are very introverted, sensitive, or emotional.
    </p>
  </div>

      <h5>Parenting</h5>
      <div class="para-2">
      <p>
      Parents of ENTJ children should recognize that their child is independent and intellectually curious. You can help your child by allowing them to pursue their curiosity. Understand that your child will often need your reasoning explained to understand why certain rules need to be followed.
      You can also help your child develop their emotional understanding by talking openly about feelings. Point out how people might feel about different experiences so that your ENTJ child can learn to better interpret both their own emotions and those of others.
    </p>
  </div>

      <h5>Relationships</h5>
      <div class="para-2">
      <p>
      An ENTJ partner can often seem quite dominating in a relationship. Because dealing with emotions does not come naturally to them, they may seem insensitive to their partner's feelings. It is important to remember that this does not mean that ENTJ’s don’t have feelings—they just need to feel completely comfortable in order to show their emotions.
      They are very committed to making relationships work and are always looking for ways that they can improve their relationships. If you have an issue with your partner, be upfront and honest. Your partner would rather hear the truth than try to guess your feelings.
