        <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">INFP: The Mediator (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Perceiving) </h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="para-1">
            INFP (introversion, intuition, feeling, perception) is a four-letter abbreviation for one of the 16
            personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator.1
            The INFP personality type is often described as an "idealist" or "mediator" personality. People with this
            kind of personality tend to be introverted, idealistic, creative, and driven by high values
            INFPs also have strong interests in making the world a better place. In addition to wanting to gain a
            greater understanding of themselves and how they fit into the world, they are also interested in how they
            can best help others. People with this personality type spend a lot of time exploring their own purpose in
            life and thinking about how they can use their skills and talents to best serve humanity.
            INFP is also the opposite personality type of ESTJ. Other similar personality types include INTP and ENFJ.
        </div>
        <h4>Key INFP Characteristics</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p><li>INFPs tend to be introverted, quiet, and reserved. Being in social situations tends to drain their
                energy, and they prefer interacting with a select group of close friends. While they like to be alone,
                this should not necessarily be confused with shyness.2 Instead, it simply means that INFPs gain energy
                from spending time alone. On the other hand, they have to expend energy in social situations.</li></p>
            <p><li>INFPs typically rely on intuition and are more focused on the big picture rather than the nitty-gritty
                details. They can be quite meticulous about things they really care about or projects they are working
                on but tend to ignore mundane or boring details.</li>
            </p>
            <p><li>INFPs place an emphasis on personal feelings, and their decisions are more influenced by these concerns
                rather than by objective information.</li>
            </p>
            <p><li>When it comes to making decisions, INFPs like to keep their options open. They often delay making
                important decisions just in case something about the situation changes. When decisions are made, they
                are usually based on personal values rather than logic.</li>

        <h4> Cognitive Functions</h4>
        <p>
            The MBTI itself is based upon a theory of personality created by the Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung.3 He
            proposed that there are four psychological components of personality: thinking, feeling, sensation, and
            intuition. People then direct each of these cognitive functions inwardly (introverted) or outwardly
            (extraverted).

        </p>
        <p>In the MBTI, each personality type is made up of a hierarchical stack of these functions. The dominant
            function is one that largely controls personality, although it is also supported by the auxiliary and, to a
            lesser degree, the tertiary functions. Inferior functions are those that are largely unconscious but still
            exert some influence.

        </p>
        <p>INFPs tend to rely on the following four cognitive functions:</p>
        <h4> Dominant: Introverted Feeling
        </h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                INFPs experience a great depth of feelings, but as introverts they largely process these emotions
                internally. They possess an incredible sense of wonder about the world and feel great compassion and
                empathy for others. While these emotions are strong, they tend not to express them outwardly, which is
                why they can sometimes be mistaken as aloof or unwelcoming.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Auxiliary: Extraverted Intuitio</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                INFPs explore situations using imagination and 'what if' scenarios, often thinking through a variety of
                possibilities before settling on a course of action. Their inner lives are a dominant force in
                personality, and they engage with the outside world by using their intuition.
            </p>
            <p>
                They focus on the "big picture" and things will shape the course of the future. This ability helps make
                INFPs transformative leaders who are excited about making positive changes in the world.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Tertiary: Introverted Sensing</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                When taking in information, INFPs create vivid memories of the events. They will often replay these
                events in their minds to analyze experiences in less stressful settings. Such memories are usually
                associated with strong emotions, so recalling a memory can often seem like reliving the experience
                itself.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Inferior: Extraverted Thinking</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                This cognitive function involves organizing and making sense of the world in an objective and logical
                manner. While this is a largely unconscious influence in the INFPs personality, it can show itself in
                times of pressure. When faced with stress, an INFP might become suddenly very pragmatic and
                detail-oriented, focusing on logic rather than emotion.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because they are typically ruled more by intuition and emotion, INFPs can sometimes struggle to feel
                productive and efficient. Learning to develop the extraverted thinking function can help people with
                this personality type create a better sense of balance.

        <h4> Tips for Interacting With INFPs</h4>

        <h5> Friendships</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p> INFPs typically only have a few close friendships, but these relationships tend to be long-lasting.
                While people with this type of personality are adept at understanding others emotions, they often
                struggle to share their own feelings with others.
            </p>
            <p>Social contact can be difficult, although INFPs crave emotional intimacy and deep relationships. Getting
                to know an INFP can take time and work, but the rewards can be great for those who have the patience and
                understanding.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Parenting</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>INFP parents are usually supportive, caring, and warm. They are good at establishing guidelines and
                helping children develop strong values.6
                Their goal as parents is to help their children grow as individuals and fully appreciate the wonders of
                the world. They may struggle to share their own emotions with their children and are often focused on
                creating harmony in the home.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Relationships</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>As with friendships, INFPs may struggle to become close to potential romantic partners. Once they do form
                a relationship, they approach it with a strong sense of loyalty.1 They can sometimes hold overly
                romanticized views of relationships and may have excessively high expectations that their partners
                struggle to live up to. They also tend to take comments personally while at the same time struggling to
                avoid conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
                If your partner is an INFP, understand that they may struggle at times to open up, be overly sensitive
                to perceived criticisms, and often place your own happiness over that of their own.
