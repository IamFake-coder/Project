        <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">INTJ: The Architect (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Judging)
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="para-1">
            <p>
                INTJ (introverted, intuitive, thinking, and judging) is one of the 16 personality types identified by a
                personality assessment called the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Sometimes referred to as the
                "Architect" or the "Strategist," people with INTJ personalities are highly analytical, creative, and
                logical.1
                According to psychologist David Keirsey, developer of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately 1 to
                4%
                of the population has an INTJ personality type.
                The MBTI is one of the most popular psychological assessments, but critics have argued that it lacks
                both
                validity and reliability.2
                If you take the MBTI, be sure to use caution when considering the meaning of your results.
                You can learn more about the INTJ personality in this overview. However, this should not be interpreted
                as
                health, psychological, or professional career advice.

        <h4>Key INTJ Characteristics</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>INTJs tend to be introverted and prefer to work alone.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>INTJs look at the big picture and like to focus on abstract information rather than concrete
                    details.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>INTJs place greater emphasis on logic and objective information rather than subjective emotions.
                </li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>INTJs like their world to feel controlled and ordered so they prefer to make plans well in advance.

        <h4> Cognitive Functions</h4>
        <p>The MBTI identifies preferences in four key dimensions: 1) Extraversion vs. Introversion, 2) Sensing vs.
            Intuition, 3) Thinking vs. Feeling and 4) Judging vs. Perceiving. As you can tell by the four-letter
            acronym,
            INTJ stands for Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, and Judging.</p>


        <p>Based upon psychoanalyst Carl Jung's theory of personality, the MBTI also utilizes what is known as a
            functional
            stack in order to understand each personality.3</p>

        <p>Each of the four key functions is either inwardly facing (introverted) or outwardly facing (extroverted). For
            each personality type, these different cognitive functions combine and interact in a variety of ways.</p>


        <p>Each type possesses a dominant function that sets the tone for that specific personality type. In addition to
            this dominant function, auxiliary, tertiary, and inferior functions play supporting roles in making up the
            characteristics of an individual's personality.</p>

        <p>INTJs rely on four key cognitive functions:</p>

        <h4> Dominant: Introverted Intuition</h4>
        <div class="para-2">

            <p>
                <li>INTJs use introverted intuition to look at patterns, meanings, and possibilities. Rather than simply
                    looking</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>at the concrete facts, they are more interested in what these facts mean.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>People with this personality type enjoy thinking about the future and exploring possibilities.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>When remembering events, they may recall impressions more than exact details of what occurred.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>INTJs are good at "reading between the lines" to figure out what things might really mean.</li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Auxiliary: Extraverted Thinking</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
            <p>
                <li>As a secondary function in the INTJ personality, extroverted thinking leads people to seek order,
                    control, and structure in the world around them.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>For this reason, INTJs can be very deliberate and methodical when approaching problems.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>People with this personality type tend to make decisions based on logic. They organize their
                    thoughts in
                    order to see cause-and-effect relationships.</li>
            </p>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Tertiary: Introverted Feeling</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>INTJs use introverted feeling but because it is a tertiary function, they do so to a lesser degree
                    than they
                    use the dominant and auxiliary functions.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Those who develop this aspect of their personalities more fully pay greater attention to values and
                    feelings
                    when making decisions.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>As a result, they may also feel more drawn to people and activities that are well-aligned with their
                    values.</li>
            </p>

        </div>

        <h4> Inferior: Extraverted Sensing</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>In INTJs, this tends to be the least developed of their cognitive functions, but it does still exert
                    some
                    influence.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>This function allows people to experience process information through their senses.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>When this function is in play, people may feel that they are living in the moment and are energized
                    by the
                    world around them.</li>
            </p>

        <h4> Tips for Interacting With INTJs
        </h4>

        <h5> Friendships</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p> INTJs tend to be solitary and self-sufficient, so establishing friendships can sometimes be difficult.
                Because people with this personality type tend to think so much of the future, they may avoid getting to
                know people because they believe that a long-term friendship will not work out.
            </p>
            <p>The good news is that while INTJs may not have a lot of friends, they do become very close and committed
                to those who persist. INTJs tend to prefer friends who are also introverted, rational, and low on
                emotional drama.6
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5> Parenting</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>INTJ parents tend to be thoughtful and attentive, yet they are typically not highly affectionate. They
                have high expectations for their kids and offer support by helping kids think logically when faced with
                decisions. Parents with this type of personality encourage their kids to be self-directed critical
                thinkers who are capable of solving problems on their own.
            </p>
            <p>If your child is an INTJ, focus on finding ways to encourage your child's intellectual strengths, but try
                to find a balance that avoids excessive perfectionism.6 You can also help your child develop their
                emotional strengths and look for ways to express their feelings.

            </p>
        </div>


        <h5>Relationships</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                Because INTJs can be difficult to get to know, romantic relationships can sometimes falter. If your
                partner has this personality type, it is important to know that loyalty and understanding are important.
                Don't be afraid to show that you are dedicated to your INTJ partner, but also don't pressure them to
                spill their emotions.</p>

            <p>Communication is also critical. Rather than expecting your partner to pick up on your subtle cues, focus
                on being straight-forward or even blunt about what you expect.</p>
