            INFJ: The Advocate (Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, Judging)
        </h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="para-1">
            <p>
                INFJ is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). Scoring as
                an
                INFJ means your personality type is best described as Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Judging.

                Sometimes referred to as the "Advocate" or the "Idealist," people with this personality type often feel
                misunderstood. Perhaps it's because they're the rarest MBTI personality type, making up only 1% to 3% of
                the
                U.S. population.1

                Or maybe it's because they're walking, talking contradictions. They're easy-going perfectionists. Both
                logical and emotional, creative and analytical.

        <h4> Key INFJ Characteristics</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>
                    Compassionate: With their strong sense of intuition and emotional understanding, INFJs can be
                    soft-spoken and
                    empathetic. This does not mean that they are pushovers, however. They have deeply held beliefs and
                    an ability to
                    act decisively to get what they want.</li>
                <li>Helper: While they are introverted by nature, people with this personality type can form strong,
                    meaningful
                    connections with other people. They enjoy helping others, but they also need time and space to
                    recharge.
                    Idealist: What sets the INFJ apart is their ability to translate their idealism into action. They
                    don't just
                    dream about changing the worldâ€”they make it happen.</li>
                <li>Organized: People with this personality type like to exert control by planning, organizing, and
                    making decisions
                    as early as possible.</li>
                <li>Both emotional and logical: When making decisions, INFJs place a greater emphasis on their emotions
                    than
                    objective facts. But this doesn't mean they see the world through rose-colored glasses. INFJs
                    understand the
                    world, both the good and the bad, and hope to be able to make it better.</li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card-1">

            <h4>Strengths</h4>
            <hr>

        </div>

        <h4>Cognitive Functions</h4>
        <p>
            The MBTI was created by Isabel Myers and her mother Katherine Briggs in the 1940s based on the theories of
            Swiss
            psychoanalyst Carl Jung. Jung believed that several mental processes made up each individual's psychological
            type. He identified four key psychological functions: thinking, feeling, sensation, and intuition. Each of
            these
            functions then tends to be either outwardly focused (extraverted) or inwardly focused (introverted).</p>

        <p>MBTI advocates often utilize what they refer to as a functional stack when analyzing results. You can think
            of
            the different cognitive functions as the ingredients that go into making up a personality type. The specific
            recipe for each type is controlled by how these different ingredients combine and interact. The MBTI itself
            relies on two key factors that combine in different ways to give us the 16 different types. First is the
            functions themselves, and second is the hierarchical order of those functions.</p>

        <p>Each type possesses a dominant function that is the core characteristic of each type. This is then supported
            by
            an auxiliary function which is another well-developed aspect of personality. The tertiary and inferior
            functions
            are less conscious and not as well-formed. </p>

        <p>INFJs tend to rely more on four primary cognitive functions:</p>


        <h4> Dominant: Introverted Intuition</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>
                    This means that they tend to be highly focused on their internal insights.</li>
                <li>Once they have formed an intuition about something, they tend to stick to it very tightly, often to
                    the
                    point of
                    being single-minded in their focus.</li>
                <li>Because of this, they are sometimes viewed as being stubborn and unyielding.</li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Auxiliary: Extraverted Feeling</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>
                    This characteristic of this type makes INFJs highly aware of what other people are feeling, but it
                    means
                    they
                    are sometimes less aware of their own emotions.</li>
                <li>INFJs sometimes struggle to say no to other people's requests for this reason. They are so attuned
                    to what
                    other
                    people are feeling that they fear causing disappointment or hurt feelings.</li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Tertiary: Introverted Thinking</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>
                    INFJs make decisions based on ideas and theories that they form based on their own insights.</li>
                <li>INFJs rely primarily on their introverted intuition and extroverted feeling when making decisions,
                    particularly
                    when they are around other people. When they are alone, however, people with this personality type
                    may rely
                    more
                    on their introverted thinking.</li>
                <li>In stressful situations, an INFJ might try to rely on emotions when making decisions, especially if
                    it means
                    pleasing other people. Under less stressful conditions, however, an INFJ is more likely to rely more
                    on
                    their
                    intuition.</li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4>Inferior: Extraverted Sensing</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>
                    While this is a less developed and largely unconscious aspect of the INFJ, it does have an impact on
                    personality.</li>
                <li>This aspect of personality helps INFJs pay attention to the world around them and stay aware of
                    their
                    surroundings.
                    Extroverted sensing also helps INFJs better live in the present moment, rather than simply worrying
                    about
                    the
                    future.</li>
                <li>This aspect of personality also helps INFJs appreciate physical activities such as hiking and
                    dancing.</li></p></div>

            <h4> Tips for Interacting With INFJs</h4>
            <h5>Friendships</h5>
            <div class="para-2">
                <p>
                    Because they are reserved and private, INFJs can be difficult to get to know. They place a high
                    value on
                    close,
                    deep relationships and can be hurt easily, although they often hide these feelings from others.
                    Interacting
                    with
                    an INFJ involves understanding and supporting their need to retreat and recharge. People with this
                    personality
                    type sometimes feel misunderstood. You can be a good friend by taking the time to understand their
                    perspective
                    and appreciating their strengths.
                </p>
            </div>


            <h5>Parenting</h5>
            <div class="para-2">
                <p>

                    Because INFJs are so skilled at understanding feelings, they tend to be very close and connected to
                    their
                    children. They have high standards and can have very high behavioral expectations. They are
                    concerned with
                    raising children that are kind, caring, and compassionate. INFJs encourage their children to pursue
                    their
                    interests and talents to fully realize their individual potential.</p>
            </div>

            <h5>Relationships</h5>
            <div class="para-2">
                <p>

                    INFJs have an innate ability to understand other people's feelings and enjoy being in close,
                    intimate
                    relationships. They tend to flourish best in romantic relationships with people with who they share
                    their
                    core
                    values. As a partner, it is important to provide the support and emotional intimacy that an INFJ
                    craves.
                    Sincerity, honesty, and authenticity are all traits that the INFJ appreciates in their partner.</p>
