    <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">ESTJ: The Director (Extraverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging)
    </h1>
    <hr>
    <div class="para-1">
      <P>
        ESTJ is one of the 16 personality types identified by the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). ESTJs are often
        described as logical, take-charge kind of people.1 They are assertive and are very concerned with making sure
        that
        things run smoothly and according to the rules. They are committed to tradition, standards, and laws. They have
        strong beliefs and possess sensible judgment, and expect that other people uphold these same principles as well.
        An estimated 8% to 12% of the U.S. population has an ESTJ personality.2﻿ David Keirsey, the creator of the
        Keirsey
        Temperament Sorter, suggests that the ESTJ personality type is the "Guardian Supervisor," one of four "Guardian"
        archetypes (Supervisor, Inspector, Provider, Protector).

    <h4>Key ESTJ Characteristics
    </h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>Individuals with this personality type tend to place a high value on tradition, rules, and security.
          Maintaining
          the status quo is important to ESTJs, and they often become involved in civic duties, government branches, and
          community organizations.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Because of their orthodox approach to life, they can sometimes be seen as rigid, stubborn, and unyielding.
          Their
          take-charge attitude makes it easy for ESTJs to assume leadership positions.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Their self-confidence and strong convictions help them excel at putting plans into action, but they can at
          times
          appear critical and overly aggressive, particularly when other people fail to live up to their high standards.
        </li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>People often describe ESTJs as predictable, stable, committed, and practical. They tend to be very frank and
          honest when it comes to sharing their opinions, which can sometimes be seen as harsh or overly critical.</li>

    <h4> Cognitive Functions</h4>
    <p>
      The MBTI suggests that each personality type is made up of a number of cognitive functions (sensing, thinking,
      feeling, and intuition) that are either directed toward the outside world (extraverted) or inward (introverted).1﻿
      The dominant function is the one that plays a primary role in personality, although the auxiliary function plays
      an important supporting role. The tertiary and inferior functions are less prominent, but can still have an
      influence on how people behave and interact with the world.

    </p>

    <h4> Dominant: Extraverted Thinking</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <li>ESTJs rely on objective information and logic to make decisions rather than personal feelings.4﻿ They are
        skilled
        at making objective, impersonal, and impartial decisions. Rather than focusing on their own subjective feelings
        when they are making judgments, they consider facts and logic in order to make rational choices.</li>

      <p>
        <li>People with ESTJ personality types tend to be very practical. They enjoy learning about things that they can
          see
          an immediate, real-world use for, but tend to lose interest in things that are abstract or theoretical. ESTJs
          enjoy concrete facts as opposed to abstract information.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>They are good at making fast and decisive choices, but they may often rush to judgment before considering
          all the
          information about a situation. One positive side, this trait makes them good leaders, but it can sometimes
          lead</li>
      </p>
      them to being viewed as harsh or abrasive.

    </div>

    <h4>Auxiliary: Introverted Sensing</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>They are good at remembering things with a great deal of detail. Their memories of past events can be quite
          vivid,
          and they often utilize their recollections of past experiences to make connections with present events.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>Because their sensing function is focused inwardly, they tend to be less concerned with novelty and more
          focused
          on familiarity. They enjoy having habits and routines that they can depend upon. While this gives them
          stability
          and predictability, it can also make them stubborn and unyielding at times.</li>
      </p>

    </div>
    <h4>Tertiary: Extraverted Intuition</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>This aspect of personality seeks out novel ideas and possibilities. It compels people with this personality
          type
          to explore their creativity.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>As they process new ideas and information, they may explore the possible meanings in order to spot new
          connections
          or patterns. This allows them to look at incoming information and recognize that there may be more than one
          interpretation or possible outcome.</li>
      </p>

    </div>

    <h4>Inferior: Introverted Feeling</h4>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        <li>When this function is used, it may lead ESTJs to make decisions based more on feelings than on logic. These
          are
          often internal valuations that lead to "gut feelings" about some situations. While this function is not used
          as
          often, in some cases a person might allow their subjective feelings to override their objective interpretation
          of
          a situation.</li>
      </p>

      <p>
        <li>ESTJs tend to give much thought to their own emotions, so this function often operates on a largely</li>

    <h4>Tips for Interacting With ESTJs</h4>

    <h5> Friendships</h5>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p> People with this personality type are sociable and enjoy getting their friends involved in activities that
        they enjoy. ESTJs often value dependability over almost everything else. If you are a stable friend who sticks
        to your commitments, you will likely be able to forge a strong friendships with an ESTJ.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h5>Parenting</h5>
    <div class="para-2">
      <p>
        ESTJs children tend to be very responsible and goal-directed, but be cautious to avoid placing too many
        expectations on your child's shoulders. They enjoy structure and routine. While they are good at being
        self-directed, they still need guidance and rules to give them the security they crave.
      </p>

      <h5>Relationships</h5>
      <div class="para-2"></div>
      <p>ESTJs are dependable and take their commitments seriously. Once they have dedicated themselves to a
        relationship, they will stay true to it for life. They tend to avoid emotions and feelings, which can be
        difficult for their partners as times. While they may not express how they feel through words, remember that
        they will often convey their emotions through actions.
