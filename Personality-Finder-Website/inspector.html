        <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">ISTJ: The Inspector (Introverted, Sensing, Thinking, Judging) </h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="para-1">
            ISTJ (introversion, sensing, thinking, judgment) is a four-letter code representing one of the 16
            personality
            types found on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI). People with an ISTJ personality type tend to be
            reserved,
            practical and quiet. They enjoy order and organization in all areas of their lives including their home,
            work, family,
            and projects. ISTJs value loyalty in themselves and others, and place an emphasis on traditions.
        </div>
        <h4>Key ISTJ Characteristics</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p><li>ISTJs are planners; they like to carefully plan things out well in advance. They enjoy an orderly life.
                They like things to be well-organized and pay a great deal of attention to detail. When things are in
                disarray, people with this personality type may find themselves unable to rest until they have set
                everything straight and the work has been completed.</li>
             <li>ISTJs are both responsible and realistic. They take a logical approach to achieving goals and completing
                projects and are able to work at a steady pace toward accomplishing these tasks. They are able to ignore
                distractions in order to focus on the task at hand and are often described as dependable and
                trustworthy.</li>
             <li>ISTJs also place a great deal of emphasis on traditions and laws. They prefer to follow rules and
                procedures that have previously been established. In some cases, ISTJs can seem rigid and unyielding in
                their desire to maintain structure.</li></p>

            <h4> Weaknesses </h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Judgmental</p>

            <p>Subjective</p>

        </div>

        <h4> Cognitive Functions</h4>
        <p>
            The MBTI suggests that the four different cognitive functions (thinking, feeling, intuition, and sensing)
            form a hierarchy. Each function is either directed outwardly (extraverted) or inwardly (introverted) and the
            order of these functions determines an individual's personality. </p>

        <h4> Dominant: Introverted Sensing</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li> Sensors are focused on the present moment, taking in an abundance of information about their
                    surroundings. </li>
                <li> They also have vivid memories of the past and rely on the memories of these experiences to form
                    expectations for
                    the future.</li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Auxiliary: Extraverted Thinking</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li> ISTJs are logical and efficient. They enjoy looking for rational explanations for events. </li>
                <li> They prefer to focus on the details rather than thinking about abstract information. </li>
                <li> Being efficient and productive is important for people with this personality type. They appreciate
                    knowledge that has immediate, practical applications. </li>
                <li> ISTJs make decisions based on logic and objective data rather than personal feelings. </li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Tertiary: Introverted Feeling</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li> As they make judgments, ISTJs often make personal interpretations based on their internal set of
                    values.</li>
                <li> This is often described as an "instinct" or "gut feeling" about a situation. ISTJ might make a
                    decision based on
                    logic, only to have this feeling kick in telling them to trust their feelings rather than just the
                    facts. </li>
            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Inferior: Extraverted Intuition </h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li> This aspect of personality enjoys new ideas and experiences.</li>
                <li>This is the weakest part of the ISTJs personality, but developing this function can sometimes lead
                    to a more
                    balanced personality.</li>
            </p>

        <h4> Tips for Interacting With ISTJs </h4>

        <h5> Friendships</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p> ISTJs tend to get along best with friends who are similar to themselves.
                While they tend to be a bit serious and by the book, they do like to have fun.
                They might not be willing to jump into new things, but you can be a great friend
                by helping them pursue hobbies and activities that they enjoy.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Parenting</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                ISTJ parents tend to be quite focused on tradition and are good at providing security
                and stability to their children. Children of ISTJ parents often find that their parents
                will treat them with care and respect and that they also expect the same treatment in return.
            </p>
            <p> Parents of ISTJ children will find that providing consistency can help their children feel more
                secure. Sticking to routines, introducing change slowly, and giving them time to adjust to new
                situations are all ways to help an ISTJ child.</p></div>
                
            <h5>Relationships</h5>
            <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                While ISTJs may experience deep feelings, they often struggle to show that side of themselves
                in romantic relationships. You can be an understanding partner by not expecting them to bare
                their soul to you right off the bat. Sometimes it may seem that your partner is not considering
                your feelings, but you can help them see your side by rationally presenting facts and logical
                explanations for your side of the argument.</p>
