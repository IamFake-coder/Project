        <h1 style="margin-top: 80px;">INTP: The Thinker (Introverted, Intuitive, Thinking, Perceiving)</h1>
        <hr>
        <div class="para-1">
            <p>
                INTP (introverted, intuitive, thinking, perceiving) is one of the 16 personality types described by the
                Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI).1 People who score as INTP are often described as quiet and
                analytical.
                They enjoy spending time alone, thinking about how things work, and coming up with solutions to
                problems.
                INTPs have a rich inner world and would rather focus their attention on their internal thoughts rather
                than
                the external world. They typically do not have a wide social circle, but they do tend to be close to a
                select group of people.
                According to psychologist David Keirsey, creator of the Keirsey Temperament Sorter, approximately 1% to
                5% of people have an INTP personality type.

        <h4>Key INTP Characteristics</h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                <li>INTPs are quiet, reserved, and thoughtful. As introverts, they prefer to socialize with a small
                    group of
                    close friends with whom they share common interests and connections.</li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>They enjoy thinking about theoretical concepts and tend to value intellect over emotion. INTPs are
                    logical
                    and base decisions on objective information rather than subjective feelings.</li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>When analyzing data and making decisions, they are highly logical and objective.</li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>Tends to be flexible and good at thinking "outside of the box."</li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>People with this personality type think about the big picture rather than focusing on every tiny
                    detail.</li>
            </p>

            <p>
                <li>INTPs like to keep their options open and feel limited by structure and planning.</li>

        <h4> Cognitive Functions</h4>
        <p>
            The MBTI is based upon psychoanalyst Carl Jung's theory which suggests that personality is made up of
            different cognitive functions. The hierarchical order of these functions is what establishes personality and
            behavioral patterns. The dominant function is the one that plays the largest role in personality, although
            it is also supported by the auxiliary. The tertiary function is less developed, but still exerts some
            influence and becomes more pronounced as a person strengthens this area. The inferior function is largely
            unconscious but represents an area of weakness.

        </p>

        <h4> Dominant: Introverted Thinking
        </h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                This function focuses on how people take in information about the world. INTPs express this by trying to
                understand how things work. They often like to break down larger things or ideas to look at the
                individual components to see how things fit and function together. INTPs tend to be highly logical and
                efficient thinkers. They like to have a complete understanding of something before they are willing to
                share an opinion or take action.


            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Auxiliary: Extraverted Intuition
        </h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                INTPs express this cognitive function by exploring what-ifs and possibilities. They utilize insight,
                imagination, and past experiences to form ideas. They often go over what they know, seeking patterns
                until they can achieve a flash of inspiration or insight into the problem. They tend to spend a great
                deal of time thinking about the future and imagining all the possibilities.


            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Tertiary: Introverted Sensing
        </h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                INTPs tend to be very detail-oriented, carefully categorizing all of the many facts and experiences that
                they take in. As they collect new information, they compare and contrast it with what they already know
                in order to make predictions about what they believe will happen next.


            </p>
        </div>

        <h4> Inferior: Extraverted Feeling
        </h4>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                INTPs tend to seek harmony in groups. While they are introverted, INTPs can be quite outgoing when they
                are around people with whom they are familiar and comfortable. In situations where they feel stress,
                however, INTPs shut down their feelings and struggle to connect with others. Under stress, they tend to
                rely on logic rather than feelings.

        <h4> Tips for Interacting With INTPs
        </h4>

        <h5> Friendships</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                Shared interests are one of the best paths to forming a friendship with an INTP. They tend to value
                intellect over all else and can be very slow to form friendships. While this often leads to fewer
                friendships, the ones that an INTP does gain tend to be very close. Remember that your INTP friends may
                not be the best at dealing with excess emotions, but they love to bond over deep conversations and
                shared passions.


            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Parenting</h5>
        <div class="para-2">
            <p>
                If your child is an INTP, it is important to remember that they may respond better to reason and logic
                rather than appeals to emotion. Encourage your child to develop their intellectual interest, but also
                look for situations that may help them foster friendships. This can be an area where your child
                struggles, but putting them in contact with other kids who share the same interests can be helpful.


            </p>

            <h5>Relationships</h5>
            <div class="para-2"></div>
            <p>
                INTPs tend to live inside their minds, so they can be quite difficult to get to know. Even in romance,
                they often hold back until they feel that the other person has proven themselves worthy of hearing these
                innermost thoughts and feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
                One thing to remember is that while INTPs do enjoy romance in the context of a deeply committed
                relationship, they do not play games. Be honest and forthright. Because INTPs are not good at
                understanding the emotional needs of others, you may need to be very direct about what you need and
                expect in that regard. INTPs also struggle to share their own feelings, so you may need to pay attention
                to subtle signals that your partner is sending.
